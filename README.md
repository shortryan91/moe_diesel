# Moe Diesel booking and beginning of website   

## Deployment    
The app has been deployed using Heroku     
Link to the website   
(https://serene-woodland-89871.herokuapp.com/ "Moe Diesel homePage")     

## The project    
This project is to have a go at bringing my parents business a Web site with a customer profile database and booking app.

## The Problem    
At the moment when you search google for Moe diesel and Automotive services the only thing that you can get is some basic google address and phone number details.    
There is no way to really see what there company is all about unless you want to google map the front of the building.

## The solution   
To build a website with functionality so that customers can sign up and add their car to there profile and then be able to schedule a booking for any vehicle in the profile they have.

## Technology     
For This project i used the Sinatra Framework which is a micro-framework.
My database is with Postgres.       
In this Framework i have made use of the ORM activeRecord to access my database tables without having to use sql queries

This app utilises RESTful routes to make a smooth control flow throughout the app.

### front-end    
This was done with just basic html and css


## unsolved / not yet tackled problems
This is really just the beginning of this app and as this app has the ability to grow so much Sinatra will probably become redundant as rails will become more suitable because    
- I would like to add a managers area where the owners have full control to adjust client data if needed even delete clients if needed   
- an area for the owners to manage what cars are in the garage and times to help keep track of how the repairs and services are running in comparison to the booking coming up.
